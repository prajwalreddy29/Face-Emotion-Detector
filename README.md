Real time face detection streamlit based bew application for server deployment.
webcam emotion detection project is a type of machine learning project that uses computer vision techniques to detect emotions from live video feeds captured by a webcam. The project typically involves training a model using a dataset of images or videos that have been labelled with different emotionss, such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, or disgust.

The model is then used to classify the emotions in real-time video feeds from a webcam. Some common techniques used in webcam emotion detection projects include feature extraction, image segmentation, facial landmark detection, and deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

The goal of a webcam emotion detection project is to develop a system that can accurately detect and classify emotions in real-time, which has many potential applications, such as in video conferencing, human-computer interaction, and marketing research.
